#crystalline

In crystalline you play as Adelle, an old woman on a journey through a crystal cavern in a puzzle platformer where the collectables are an essential part of puzzle strategy.

###story

Adelle own a Crystal Healing shop in Sedona, AZ and in the mesa behind it is a crystal cavern. She enters the cave and begins her quest to the top. Along the way we discover that she is dying and is searching for a giant healing crystal that can restore her to her youth.

###gameplay

In the platforming portion Adelle sneaks her way through the crystal cavern, avoiding the increasing unnatural creatures that inhabit it. She must hide behind crystal formations and sneak past creatures to get the crystals she needs. The crystals are embedded in ground and appear as a flash of colored light. It takes a brief action to collect a crystal so they must be factored into the stealth timing. 

Adelle’s range of movement is limited by her age. She can jump only 1-2 tiles off the ground and can climb up short heights above that. However there are large healing crystal formations in various places around the level that when Adelle gets near fill her with a temporary surge of youthful invigoration. These crystals are permanent level fixtures and are reusable. Her avatar will noticeably behave younger, including gentle color pallet shift and posture change. Young Adelle can jump much higher and climb a greater range of heights but the youthfulness is limited in duration. This adds a element of speed-run style strategy to the platforming element.

The world is open and multi-floored with wide horizontal sections occupied by huge stalactites and crystal formations. The other primary level shape is a large tiered vertical corridor. These are only traversable when Adelle is in ‘young form’ and serve to break up sections of the level. There are invisible checkpoints that trigger whenever Adelle moves through a section so player death is only a minor setback.

####Enemies
There are two kinds of natural creature living in the cavern. Crystal Slugs are the most often encountered monster, and slither around the cavern floor. Sightless and glowing, they are mostly harmless. However, when they are alerted to danger they emit a toxic aura from their bodies that will on contact. If Adelle bumps into a slug it will recoil and instantly trigger alert state. When alerted the slugs will move more quickly about their path and try to find the disturbance. Slugs live in lair like holes that are rich with crystals.

The second kind of enemy is the Crystal Bat. Crystal Bats don’t directly attack Adelle, but rather hang from the ceiling and sweep across the level with their laser vision. If a bat spots Adelle it will immediately begin emitting echo-locative rays and tones which will put all the slugs in a radius on alert. Each bat on the level will have a unique tone/pattern so that when multiple bats are triggered during the speed run portion a more intense light/sound effect happens diegetically. In later levels bats will fly from perch to perch on the ceiling to increase challenge. 


####Puzzles
At certain points of the level, there are hand-crafted radial puzzle-doors. Adelle must complete these puzzle doors to advance another areas. The puzzles are concentric wheels with different arms and sockets for crystals. Adelle fills the sockets with the crystals she collects and then rotates the arms to form a pattern of crystal ‘stars’ matching a pattern in her book of constellations. Each door matches a specific pattern, but which can only be discovered through trial and error.




#####An exemplary area may flow like this:

* Adelle sneaks and clamors her way along the ground of the level, past piles of squirming, squelching crystal snails, collecting colored crystals off the ground.

* Adelle finds a puzzle door and attempts to solve it. The Player realizes that they need more crystals than they have to solve it. 

* Adelle explores sloping offshoots to the main passage (slug nests, alcoves) and finds the crystals they need. At least one passage is inaccessible.

* Player solves the radial arm puzzle and opens the door. 

* Behind the door is an area with a healing crystal cluster in it. Adelle is given temporary mobility.

* The Player has to scope out and decide which of the previously inaccessible paths they want to explore and make a speed run while “young” to get there.

* Adelle reverts in age and another stealthy puzzle sections begins.

* Mix and match these pieces as the levels increase in complexity.
